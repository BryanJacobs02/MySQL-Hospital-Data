# SQL Database Design for a Hospital System
*Final project for [INFO 579: SQL/NoSQL Databases](https://infosci.arizona.edu/course/info-579-database-design-sql) â€” University of Arizona*
  
  
## Project Intro/Objective
This report demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database for a hypothetical hospital, applying key concepts of database normalization, modeling, and SQL querying. Beginning with the identification of essential hospital entities such as patients, doctors, treatments, medications, and departments, the database was developed to capture their relationships in a structured and consistent manner. Through the use of conceptual, logical, and physical models, many-to-many relationships were properly resolved with junction tables, ensuring referential integrity and eliminating data redundancy. A variety of SQL queries were then constructed to retrieve, join, and filter data, illustrating the application of joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and conditional logic.
